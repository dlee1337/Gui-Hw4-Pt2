GUI Assignment: Homework 4, Part 2 implementing jQuery sliders and tabs.

Description:
For this assignment we were responsible for implementing sliders and tabs.
Note: I was only able to implement the sliders because the tab methods that we were supposed to implement is outdated and not compatible with the current version of jQuery UI 1.14, 
its only present in 1.8 (it also conflicts with jQuery 3.7.1 which I checked via F12 inspect). The main method we would use to achieve the goal highlighted in the pdf would come by 
way of the add method but for with the time that I had there was no add method and I couldn't find an alternative method. These are the resources I used:
- The jQuery Slider/Tab chapter provided to us in the blackboard pdf.
- https://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-show I tried consulting this to see if I could do anything with tabs
- I referred to the lecture notes for some basic syntax related stuff.
I added additionally another script src line which can be observable towards the top of the html document. This was to make it possible for the slider to be seen.
The main observable change in Part 2 can be observed where I wrote the script directly underneath the body in the html file, which likely isn't best practice.
